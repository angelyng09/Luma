Luma Technical Roadmap (Community-First, Build-Ready Version)
1. Product Philosophy 
Luma is not an indoor navigation app and not a static accessibility map. 
It is a community-driven accessibility intelligence platform that helps visually impaired users:
- Decide whether a place is usable before going
- Understand what to expect once there
- Contribute real-time, experience-based knowledge that benefits others
- Influence institutional change through aggregated feedback

This aligns with your pivot away from expensive custom mapping and toward scalable user-generated value.

2. Core System Architecture (High-Level)
Client (iOS / SwiftUI)
- Voice-first interface (VoiceOver-native)
- Minimal gestures, no visual dependency
- Offline-tolerant caching
Backend (API + Database)
- Places & accessibility intelligence
- Community feedback + trust signals
- Temporal weighting (recency matters)
- Moderation + credibility scoring
AI / Logic Layer (Lightweight, Rule-Based First)
- Voice-to-text parsing
- Feedback categorization
- Summary generation (“What people say about this place”)

3. Core User Flows (Rebuilt Without QR Codes)
3.1 Pre-Visit Decision Flow (Primary Use Case)
Goal: Help users decide if a place is worth going to.

User Actions
Voice input:

“Can I go to X hospital safely?”
“How accessible is this mall for blind users?”

System returns:
- Ranked place list
- Spoken summary first, details optional
- System Output (Very Specific)

For each place:
- Overall Accessibility Confidence Score (0–100)
(Not “rating” — confidence implies uncertainty + evidence)
- What Works Well (top 2)
- Common Problems (top 2)
- Last Community Update (“2 hours ago”)

Who This Place Works For
- Blind users with cane
- Wheelchair users
- Low vision users

Technical Implementation
- PlaceIndex table with:
    -Weighted score = Σ(dimension × recency × user credibility)
- NLP clustering of comments into:
    - recurring positives
    - recurring negatives
- Voice-first summary auto-generated from clusters

3.2 On-Site Experience Flow (Without QR)
Goal: Let users quickly understand what others experienced recently at the same place.

Trigger Methods
- GPS proximity
- Manual voice command:
  “I’m inside X mall now”

System Response
 “Here’s what people reported today at this location:”
    - Elevator working (confirmed 3 hours ago)
    - Security desk helpful
    - Restroom hard to locate

Technical Functions
- Geo-fenced place detection
- Time-decayed feedback prioritization
- Local cache of recent reports (for poor connectivity)

3.3 Real-Time Community Feedback Loop (Core Value)

Feedback Submission (Voice-Only by Default)
User speaks:
  “The elevator near the east entrance is broken.”
System Pipeline
- Speech → text
- Auto-tagging:
    - Facility: elevator
    - Status: broken
    - Confidence: high (concrete observation)
User confirms via voice:
  “Is this correct?”
    Stored As
    Feedback {
      place_id
      issue_type
      severity
      timestamp
      confidence_level
      user_reputation_weight
    }

Immediate Effects
- Other users are alerted
- Place score temporarily adjusted
- Venue dashboard updated (future phase)

4. Accessibility Dimensions (Operationalized)

Instead of abstract dimensions, each becomes measurable signals.

4.1 Dimensions → Signals
Navigation Clarity
- Number of reports mentioning “confusing”
- Presence of staff assistance reports

Facility Reliability
- Elevator uptime (% of last 30 days)
- Restroom accessibility consistency

Sensory Environment
- Noise complaints
- Overcrowding frequency by time of day

Staff Responsiveness
- Mentions of help received
- Problem resolution follow-ups

5. Trust, Credibility & Cold-Start Strategy
5.1 User Credibility Scoring (Internal)
- Feedback history
- Consistency with others
- Time-on-platform
- Users don’t see a “score” — the system uses it silently.

5.2 Anti-Misinformation Controls
- Conflicting reports flagged
- “Unconfirmed” labels for single reports
- Automatic decay of old reports

6. Community Exchange Features (Beyond Reviews)
6.1 Ask-the-Community
Users can ask:
  “Is this hospital manageable alone?”
Others reply with voice responses.

6.2 Experience Threads
Instead of reviews:
  “My visit today”
  “What changed since last time”
These are time-based narratives, not star ratings.

7. Metrics 
Adoption
- Monthly active blind users
- Voice queries per user
Engagement
- Feedback submissions per visit
- Replies to community questions
Coverage
- % of key Shanghai venues with ≥5 recent reports
Impact
- Reduced “failed trips” (user self-report)
- Venue response rate (future)

8. MVP Scope (Strict, Buildable)
- Voice search & summaries
- Community feedback (voice → structured)
- Time-weighted accessibility confidence
- Location-based recent reports
- VoiceOver-first UX
